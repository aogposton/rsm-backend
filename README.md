# Simple Backend Portfolio Piece

This repo was created to display my ability to stand up a backend. It was created for 1 specific company interview but will remain availble for anyone else to also verify my ability.

## Highlights

-   1 migration for creating a table
-   database seeding
-   model for viewing database objects
-   simple api and routing
-   middleware for allowing cors
